# Mobile App and Malware Classifications using Mobile usage and Time Dynamics

## About the Project: 
Malicious activities in mobile applications may affect the mobile usages and even leave security concerns in the mobile applications. For example, they may drain the batteries, use up CPU or memories, increase bandwidth utilization, and even steal our information. In this paper, we analyze the Sherlock data to explore the patterns in mobile usage by different types of the mobile apps and their benign or malicious status. These initial findings potentially are helpful to assist malware detections and usage warning. 

## Usage and Analysis
There are two major analytical work we are interested in. The ?rst one is usage analysis [19] in which we perform statistical tests to learn whether the mobile usages (i.e., the low-privileges features, such as CPU, memory, battery usages) are signi?cantlydifferentamongdifferentapps,andwhethertheyaredifferentbetween the benign and malicious running state of each app. Furthermore, we try to correlate these patterns with the malware behavior (such as stealing information, photo theft, click-jacking, etc), and observe whether they are consistent. In addition, we exploit the temporal analysis, where we are particularly interested in how users use theseappsovertime,andwhethertherearedifferentusagepatternsamongtheapps. The malicious behaviors will be randomly simulated on the apps. It is higher possible to observe malicious activities if users use an app more frequently in a speci?c time period. These time dynamics may be helpful in the predictive tasks (i.e., app classi?cation and malware detections) we are going to perform in our work.


### Professor: 

Professor can view the students who has registered for his course and he could accept them or reject. And can grade accepted students and comment the links and contents for them to learn, No registration for professor as well, by default one professor.
a.	Userid : pr501 : password : pass1

### Student: Student needs to register an account, post registration could view the course add/drop them. And can view the updates from the professor. At every stages.

Tables Used:
1.	User-info: consists of userid, passwords, is user the admin, student or professor informations.
2.	Student-data: consists of the student information once he registers. 
3.	Course-info : information about courseid, coursename and credits.
4.	Professor-info: professor-name, professorid, experience.
5.	Student-course: the courses that student registers for with professorid
6.	Prof-course: professor course means the courses they teach, with the professor name.
